# Review Doc for bigfoot.js

## 1. Architecture Design

Bigfoot.js is designed as a jQuery plugin that enhances HTML footnotes. The architecture follows a modular approach within a **single file**:

1. **Plugin Initialization**: The main function `$.bigfoot()` is called to initialize the plugin.
2. **Configuration**: A comprehensive set of default options allows for customization.
3. **Core Functionality**: Functions like `createPopover`, `removePopovers`, and `repositionFeet` form the backbone of the plugin's functionality.
4. **Event Handling**: Functions like `buttonHover` and `touchClick` manage user interactions.
5. **Utility Functions**: Smaller helper functions are scattered throughout the file.

## 2. Code Organization

The code is primarily contained within a single CoffeeScript file (bigfoot.coffee). While this approach keeps everything in one place, it may hinder maintainability for larger codebases. Key aspects of the organization include:

## 3. Pattern and Language Use

1. **Language**: The project uses CoffeeScript, which was popular when the project was created but has since declined in usage.
2. **Design Pattern**: It follows the jQuery plugin pattern, encapsulating all functionality within a single jQuery function.
3. **Closure for Privacy**: The main function creates a closure, providing privacy for variables and functions.
4. **Event Delegation**: The code uses event delegation for efficiency, attaching events to the document and filtering based on selectors.
5. **Callback Pattern**: The plugin allows for callback functions, enhancing extensibility.

## 4. Repository Organization

The repository structure is straightforward but could be improved:

Pros:
- Clear separation of source and distribution files.
- Includes both minified and non-minified versions of the JS file.

Cons:
- No clear structure for tests or examples.
- Lack of a dedicated documentation folder.

## 5. Tool Quality

The project uses Grunt as its build tool, which was popular at the time but has since been largely replaced by more modern tools. The Gruntfile.coffee configures several tasks:


## 6. Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
1. Easy to use and integrate with existing jQuery projects.
2. Highly customizable through a wide range of options.
3. Handles complex footnote scenarios and positioning.
4. Responsive design considerations.

Disadvantages:
1. No apparent test suite, making it difficult to ensure reliability across changes.
2. All functionality in a single file, which could hinder maintainability.
3. Performance concerns with extensive DOM manipulation.
4. Dependency on jQuery, which is less common in modern web development.
5. Use of CoffeeScript, which has fallen out of favor.
6. Outdated build tools and development dependencies.
7. Potential accessibility issues for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Overall, this is a simple tool to enhance the functionality of footnotes in HTML. The project structure is fairly simple, easy to understand. However, the code of the tool itself is a bit of a smell. First of all, the code is poor-structured, there is no modularization in this project, making it very hard to read. Even more difficult to debug or trackdown a specific functionality. In addition, the code has no test converage, which makes code changes at a higher risks. We would never know when we step on a footgun, changes might easily break the entire functionality. To develop or build something on top of this requires an overall understanding of the codebase, as well as multiple refactors. The effort doing so might just be as time-consuming as building a new footnote tool from scratch.
